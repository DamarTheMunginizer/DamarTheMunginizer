## Projects
- [Life Expectancy Analysis](https://github.com/DamarTheMunginizer/Life-Expectancy-Analysis)
   - Explored the relationship between population size and life expectancy using regression models to expose any trends.
- [Ames Housing Data](https://github.com/DamarTheMunginizer/Ames-Housing-Price-Estimator)
   - A linear regression model to predict housing prices at the close of sell based on various features.
- [Reddit NLP Classifier](https://github.com/DamarTheMunginizer/NLP-Binary-Classifier-Project)
   - Binary classifier to predict subreddit topics using NLP preprocessing (lemmatization, stop-word removal, vectorization).
- [Income Probaility Prediction Hackathon(Collaboration Project)](https://github.com/DamarTheMunginizer/Hackathon)
   -  Collaborated in a group of 5 to predict the probaility of someone making (<50K or >50K)(We were restricted to 1 model (Random Forest) but in our test we achieved 86% accuracy but on the actual data we were looking for we achived a 98% acuuracy.
- [Renewable Power Optimization for New York State(Collaboration Project)](https://github.com/DamarTheMunginizer/New-York-State-Energy-Consumption)
    - Analyzed renewable energy options to recommend solutions that minimize carbon footprint and maximize energy production for the state.
## What I'm Working on
- [Customer Lifetime Value(CLV)](#)
    - Build predictive models to estimate customer lifetime value for financial products.
    - Techniques: Feature engineering, Machine Learning, Regression Based, Tree-Based, Time Series, and Custom Models.
